<p>Increasingly, colleges enjoy hefty donations from people or entities that are based abroad. In 2003 colleges received $71.2 million in gifts. By 2012, that number grew to 261.9 million, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education, which did an overall analysis of colleges that received big foreign gifts. UC Berkeley, a globally recognized campus, is no exception. I’m interested in the money that funds higher education, and foreign donations are a part of that.  </p>
<p>Particularly, I’m interested in that relationship at public institutions like UC Berkeley. Their public missions are in question: their finances are usually more visible than their private counterparts, so it’s easier to keep them accountable. From South Africa divestment movements to the modern day call to divest from fossil fuels, the UC takes small steps to cater to these movements. A few years ago it divested from crude oil, and then from private prisons. But who does it receive massive foreign donations from? Where a university gets money can be similarly reflective of the biggest corporate or government interests driving a university like UC Berkeley.</p>
<p>I hope to detail how Berkeley compares to other schools in terms of foreign donations, and what kinds of entities it gets its foreign money from.</p>

<p>Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 mandates that colleges (that participate in Title IV assistance programs) report donations from foreign entities if the total of all foreign gifts have a value of $250,000 or more in a calendar year, according to the student aid government website. </p>
<p>Dan Bauman, a data reporter at The Chronicle of Higher Education back in 2014 <a href="http://www.chronicle.com/article/Thanks-to-Outreach-US/148313">analyzed</a> Education Department foreign gift data. He analyzed 10 years of gift data from 2003-2012. That data is housed on his <a href="https://github.com/danbauman77/Foreign-Gifts-to-Colleges">github</a>. The Education Department since then has removed pre-2010 data. There is, however, still <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/about/data-center/school/foreign-gifts">data from 2010-2016</a> on the Education Department’s student aid website.</p>
<h3 id="questions-to-ask-of-the-data"><a name="questions-to-ask-of-the-data" href="#questions-to-ask-of-the-data"></a>Questions to ask of the data</h3>
<ul>
<li>How does UC Berkeley compare to other school in total amount of foreign donations? How does UC Berkeley compare to other University of California institutions? In an initial look at the data, we can see UC Berkeley received $103.9m (in 2013 inflation adjusted dollars) in foreign donations. They were the fifth-largest recipient of foreign monetary donations after John Hopkins ($187m), Columbia ($225.8m), Stanford ($241.2m) and Harvard ($479.7m).</li><li>Where geographically is Berkeley getting the most money from, and what kinds of foreign entities are donating to UC Berkeley? Some notes of interest, $16 million in contracts between foreign pharma companies. $8 million in gifts/contracts with Samsung. Huge gifts from foreign governments like Saudi Arabia and Israel.</li></ul>

<li>UC Berkeley amount of foreign donations in relation to other universities. A simple horizontal bar graph could detail how UC Berkeley compares to other schools.</li><li>A map showing flows in thicknesses corresponding to amount of money, which countries donations to UC Berkeley are coming from.</li><li>A bar chart with smaller units that shows how much money is coming from each country to UC Berkeley in comparison to the other, but also breaks down into what kind of entity its coming from (e.g. government, private company, individual). I think I would have to go through the data and classify these by hand.</li></ul>
